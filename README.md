### Binary Search Tree
While a perfect binary search tree has O(logn) complexity for all operations, inserts and removes may degenerate the tree into a doubly linked list. Which means all operations take O(n) in the worst case.

- Search:
	- Average: O(logn)
	- Worst: O(n)	
- Insert:
	- Average: O(logn)
	- Worst: O(n)	
- Delete: 
	- Average: O(logn)
	- Worst: O(n)

### Tracked Array
Array that keeps track of empty indices. 
- Search
	- Average: O(n)
- Insert
	- Average: O(n)
- Delete
	- O(1)
